## ❗ Limitations

- ❌ No functional backend
- ❌ No interactivity (no login, signup, or video streaming)
- ➡️ This project focuses **only on UI and responsive design**.

## 🌐 Live Demo

👉 [View Live Project](https://ojasviranaiitism.github.io/Nextflix_Clone/)

## ⚠️ Quick Heads-Up!

If the live project link opens up and shows something like **“Dangerous site ❌”**—don’t panic! 😄

👉 Just click **“Details”** and then scroll down to the line that says:  
_“Only visit **this unsafe site** if you're sure you understand the risks.”_  
The words **this unsafe site** will be **underlined**—click that to continue.

---

No worries! The website might trigger this warning because it has an **input textbox**, which some browsers suspect could be part of phishing (spoiler: it’s not 😄).  

✅ It’s completely safe—you're just checking out my project!
